**Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up the three-tier application on your local machine:

**Prerequisites**

Docker installed on your system (Get Docker)
Docker Compose installed on your system (Get Docker Compose)

**Installation**

Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository:
bash
Copy code
cd <repository-name>
Build and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
Access the application in your web browser:
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend: http://localhost:4000

**Application Structure**

Our three-tier application is structured as follows:

**Frontend:** React.js application encapsulated within a Docker container.
**Backend:** Node.js application serving as the backend logic, also encapsulated within a Docker container.
**Database:** PostgreSQL database running in its own Docker container.

**Docker Configuration**

Frontend
The frontend Dockerfile is located in the frontend directory. It builds the frontend image and exposes port 3000.

dockerfile
Copy code
FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json .
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]

Backend
The backend Dockerfile is located in the backend directory. It builds the backend image and exposes port 4000. The backend service depends on the database service.

dockerfile
Copy code
FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json .
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 4000

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
Database
The PostgreSQL Dockerfile is located in the root directory. It configures the PostgreSQL database and sets up the necessary environment variables.

dockerfile
Copy code
FROM postgres:alpine

ENV POSTGRES_DB todo_db
ENV POSTGRES_USER admin
ENV POSTGRES_PASSWORD password
Docker Compose
The docker-compose.yml file orchestrates the setup of multiple Docker containers for the three-tier application.

yaml
Copy code
version: '3'
services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: todo_db
      POSTGRES_USER: admin
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
